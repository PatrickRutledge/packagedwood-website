        <section class="history">
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>AMP is a family owned and operated business in the "Magic City", Birmingham, Alabama. The company was founded by two ladies in 2022 to provide co-packing service to increase capacity of a local firewood manufacturing operation. Since that time Liz and Misti have automated the factory and increased the business to service customers involved in mass retail.</p>
            <p>The girls still work the business everyday to make sure each batch of products meets the requirements of their customers. They also strive to use pre-consumer content in products. Pre-consumer Recycling is the movement of material from a finished or partially finished product backwards into the production chain. Materials are sourced from the point of harvest or at the beginning of the production process before the introduction of any foreign substance. Sustainability and the promise of industrial ecology are well served when materials are diverted from landfills.</p>
